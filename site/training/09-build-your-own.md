# Lesson 9: Build Your Own

After going through the lessons, it's time to put all your newly learned skills together and build a block by yourself. Spend no more than ~4 hours on this block.

## What to Build

Your task is to build a block called "Author Byline". The block should show the author of the current post next to their avatar image. There should be a block setting for hiding the avatar image.

To start you should make a clone of the [10up WP Scaffold](https://github.com/10up/wp-scaffold). The block should be created as a part of the theme.

## Technical Specifications

* Built as a dynamic block
* Following 10up Best Practices
* Follows block building patterns shown in the [10up WP Scaffold example block](https://github.com/10up/wp-scaffold/tree/trunk/themes/10up-theme/includes/blocks/example-block).
