# 10up Gutenberg Best Practices 

This repository houses the source code for the [10up Gutenberg Best Practices website](https://gutenberg.10up.com).

The content of this site is grouped into three different sections: Training, Reference, and Guides. 

## Training
The training section is meant for hands on learning. By covering the most common development topics in order this will get anyone up to speed with how we build experiences for the editor at 10up.

## Reference
The reference section on the other hand is a place for detailed reference explications on everything surrounding the block editor.

## Guides
Guides are one off articles that go into depth on one particular topic.
