In addition to the default export, this packages also exports:
- `@10up/headless-next/config`: For using with `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs`
- `@10up/headless-next/middlewares`: Contains next.js middlewares. Exported separately as the next.js middleware runtime is limited and can only run a subset of APIs.
